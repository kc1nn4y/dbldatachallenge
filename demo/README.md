## Visualizations Demo
This demo uses csv files containing sentiment data to create visualizations for a specific timeframe.  
The csv files are distributed among several WinRar archives, which can be unpacked using [WinRar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=16).

## Choosing the corect timeframe parameters
Use [this](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php) website to convert a specific starting and end date to unix timestamps.  
Be sure that these timestamps are in the format of milliseconds (13 digits).  
  
Insert the start date timestamp and end date timestamp into the following sections of the notebook:  
```py
start_date_timestamp = 1580511601000
end_date_timestamp = 1582930799000
```
